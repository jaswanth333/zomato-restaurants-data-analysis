# zomato restaurants data analysis

## Findings

From the exploratory data analysis,it can be understood that locality with highest number of restaurants
have more online orders with average cost of food.It is also surprising to see that most of the restaurants in
the Bangalore area are serving North Indian and Chinese cuisines followed by South Indian cuisines.Based
on the output from top foods it is evident that people are preferring fast foods than regular meals.Finally
the results from word cloud showed that customers are talking frequently about food,place,order and taste.
When it comes to modeling,we tried to predict cost_for_two by fitting Linear regression with only numerical
variables and with both numerical and categorical variables.From the results we interpreted that the simple
model is doing better in terms of predicting the cost when compared to model 2.After fitting neural network
we noticed that model is over fitting,hence it is not recommended for this data.

## Recommendation

There are comparatively less restaurants in locality – “New BEL Road” as per Zomato data. Restaurants
in this locality can be expanded to appear more frequently in recommendations.
Significantly,there are higher number of restaraunts who are not into online ordering,executives at zomato
should try to explain the its importance to them so that it will be helpful in the business development.
Restaurants in “Lavelle Road” has lowest percentage of online orders. So Zomato should concentrate on
providing discount or promo codes or offers to those restaurants to grab customer’s attraction.
People are more inclined towards North Indian and Chinese cuisines so Zomato should give suggestions to
their partnered restaurants to include more of those dishes in their menu.
